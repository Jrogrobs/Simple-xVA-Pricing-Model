**Simple xVA Pricing Model**

This repository contains my take on a minimal xVA (CVA/DVA/FVA) pricing engine with a small GUI, aimed at quantitative finance applications.

ðŸš§ Work in progress: Iâ€™m actively developing features and tightening assumptions. A technical note detailing pricing assumptions and formulas will be added soon.
